Summary: Automatically select a subset of predictors for use in predic
 tive modeling procedures
Description: This extension provides a user interface for the SELECTPR
 ED command. It takes a specified set of predictor variables as input 
 and selects a smaller subset for use in predictive modeling procedure
 s. A univariable method that considers each predictor in isolation is
  used, as opposed to the multivariable method of selecting predictors
  that is used by the Na√Øve Bayes Classifier extension. The Select Pre
 dictors extension supports both categorical and scale dependent varia
 bles. Large sets of predictors can be handled.
